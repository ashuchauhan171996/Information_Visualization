# Information_Visualization
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice in terms of creating information visualizations of data that are not just numerical/statistical.

## Data:

You should use the following datasets:

* Electric Vehicle Population Data (https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2Links to an external site.)
* Vehicle Registration Summary (https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Vehicle-Registration-Summary/8xjw-yrdyLinks to an external site.).
* GeoNames Postal Code, specifically “US.zip” (http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/Links to an external site.)
 
You can download the vehicle datasets by pressing the “Export” button on the top right and choosing a format that works for you. When displaying data on maps, you may find it useful to convert zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates (see GeoNames Postal Code dataset). You do not need to visualize the entire dataset as there is a large amount of data. The visualizations you create will typically be of only a subset of the data.

# Code and Generating Visualizations:

Your homework project should be done in a coding language, not in a separate visualization tool/suite.  The choice of language (Python/Java/C++/Javascript/R/others) is up to you, however.  Furthermore, you are expected to use libraries to provide support for creating these visualizations; a list of such libraries is below.  You should write a program that will import the data and will generate visualizations from it as described below.  You may generate all visualizations via a single program, or may write separate programs to generate various visualizations.

Note that visualizations should be “complete”.  That is, they should include labels of axes or other parts as appropriate, a meaningful title, and so forth.  You should use color as seems appropriate to you (e.g. if you use a stacked bar graph, you need different colors there), though you will not be judged on whether the particular colors chosen are actually “good.”

To achieve a standard B grade (of 85% at most), you will need to include at least 4 visualizations; the list to choose from is below.  Specifically you should include:

At least one from the connection and flow category
At least one from the Hierarchies category
At least one from the Maps category
One from any category of your choice
You may use a Node-Link layout for either Connection and Flow, or for Hierarchies, but not both
